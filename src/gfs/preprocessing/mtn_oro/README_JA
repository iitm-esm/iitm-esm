For Using/creating/running Orography/Mountain Blocking fix fields files or code:
The following will set up a set of input and output files for a ocean lsm test 
run as well as for any other resolution, one at a time.

To execute your own Orog fix field maker to create files to input to GFS 
(mtnvar{$jcap}) or chgres, etc (orogb{$jcap}) or (slmgb{$jcap}) and other files.

1) Create a Directory to run and keep files,  I will choose for this example:
ptmpp2 and ptmp=ptmpp2
2) copy files and tars to a directory say on ptmp where you can write changing
    /ptmpp2/Jordan.Alpert/ to your /ptmpp2/$LOGNAME
cp -R /global/noscrub/Jordan.Alpert/terr/nggp /ptmpp2/Jordan.Alpert/.
3) Untar and delete old test file print output - these will reappear after run.
tar -xvf terr_lsm_oc.tar
/bin/rm out_190.out  terr.errout  terr.stdout
4)  There are two examples included to kick off the execute:
qbsub_mtnlsm1534.3072x1536_878-1536.sh # For T1534 3072x1536 and filter 878-1536
and
qbsub_mtnlsm190.384x190_128-192.sh     # For 384x190 Gaussian grid w/ocean lsm

for example:
cd /ptmpp2/$LOGNAME/nggp
./qbsub_mtnlsm1534.3072x1536_878-1536.sh
